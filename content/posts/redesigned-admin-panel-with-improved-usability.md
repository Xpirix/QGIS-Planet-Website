<p>The admin panel has been redesigned to better align with our design guidelines and provide a clearer overview of your server usage. Key improvements include:</p><ul>
<li><p>A refreshed look with improved workspace, project, and user detail views</p></li>
<li><p>A new overview page displaying server usage statistics</p></li>
<li><p>The ability to grant admin panel access to other users directly from the UI</p></li>
<li><p>An option to export usage data for easier reporting</p></li>
</ul><p>This update is now available for <strong>Enterprise</strong> users, with the <strong>Community edition</strong> update coming soon!</p>
