<div class="ql-editor read-mode"><p>It was fantastic to catch up with the authors at the FOSS4G 2022 conference and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1an2zLhhsk" rel="noopener noreferrer">talk about the new edition</a> (and get some selfies). I was excited to receive a copy of QGIS for Hydrological Applications on my return from the conference and having taken the time to read and work through the book I have come to the following conclusion: QGIS for Hydrological Applications Second Edition is not just a book for Hydrologists but for anyone who wants to improve their QGIS skills through practical, real-world examples that happen to be hydrological.Â </p><p><br/></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="/img/subscribers/kartoza/kartoza-book-review-qgis-for-hydrological-applications-second-edition/RSabEOm.gif"/></p><p><br/></p><p>The book has eight Chapters: Preparing Data from Hard Copy Maps, Importing Tabular Data into QGIS, Spatial Analysis with Map Algebra, Stream and Catchment Delineation, Adding Open Data to Your Catchment, Calculating Percentage of Land Cover per Subcatchment, Map Design and Conclusion. The book is set up like a QGIS workflow with each section leading on from the next culminating in all the skills needed to create pleasing and functional map.</p><p><br/></p><p><img src="/img/subscribers/kartoza/kartoza-book-review-qgis-for-hydrological-applications-second-edition/kzuELXU.webp"/></p><p><br/></p><p>Each chapter begins with a workflow showing what will be done in a step-by-step fashion. These workflows are not QGIS-specific and could be executed in other software if needed, but the general logic and analysis required are outlined from the get-go which is useful for anyone improving their GIS skills. The exercises are written methodically, with an abundance of full-colour screenshots, and are easy to follow, particularly when paired with the videos on Hans van der Kwast's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/HansvanderKwast" rel="noopener noreferrer">Youtube Channel</a>.</p><p><br/></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="/img/subscribers/kartoza/kartoza-book-review-qgis-for-hydrological-applications-second-edition/hIUqtAB.webp"/></p><p style="text-align: center;"><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>See the QOD Book review session here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YgNVQz4PegQ</p></div>
