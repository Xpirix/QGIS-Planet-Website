<p><strong><a href="https://security.qgis.oslandia.com"><img alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-9276 alignright" height="129" src="/img/subscribers/qgis_oslandia/le-security-project-for-qgis-contribuez-maintenant/logo_qgis_security_project-300x129.webp" width="300"/></a>The <a href="https://security.qgis.oslandia.com">“<em>Security project for QGIS</em>” is now public</a> ! Pledge now ! </strong></p>
<p><strong>The goal of this project is to mutualize funding to improve QGIS security to the highest levels.</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://oslandia.com">Oslandia</a> and other involved partners, especially <a href="https://opengis.ch">OPENGIS.ch</a> are OpenSource “<em>pure players</em>” and main contributors to QGIS. This project is an initiative by Oslandia and is endorsed by the QGIS.org association. We work closely with the community of developers, users and stakeholders of QGIS. This project involves QGIS core committers willing to advance QGIS security.</p>
<h2>Global context</h2>
<p><strong><img class="alignleft" height="182" src="" width="323"/>New regulations</strong> like NIS2 and CRA in Europe, as well as other international or local regulations will be activated within the next couple of years. They require software and software producers to <strong>improve their cybersecurity practices</strong>. OpenSource softwares, while usually having a special treatment, are concerned too. Estimated costs of CRA impact on an opensource project amounts to +30%.</p>
<p>As for QGIS, we consider that the project stays behind what would be sufficient to comply with these regulations. We also do not fulfill requirements coming from our end-users, in terms of overall software quality regarding security, processes in place to ensure trust in the supply chain, and overall security culture in the project.</p>

QGIS faces the risk of IT departments blocking QGIS installations if they consider the project not having enough consideration for security.</p>
<p>Also, requests to <a href="mailto:security@qgis.org">security@qgis.org</a> have grown significantly.</p>
<h2>Project goals</h2>
<p><a href="https://security.qgis.oslandia.com"><img alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-9672 alignright" height="184" src="/img/subscribers/qgis_oslandia/le-security-project-for-qgis-contribuez-maintenant/00a9b8ec-580a-440a-8b28-b286414a8080-300x184.webp" width="300"/></a>Oslandia, with other partners and backed by clients and end-users,<strong> launch the “Security project for QGIS”</strong> : we identified key topics where security improvements can be achieved, classified them, and created work packages to work on, with budget estimations.</p>
<ul>
<li>The main goal is simple :<strong> raise the cybersecurity level for the QGIS project</strong></li>
<li><strong>Fulfill cybersecurity requirements</strong> from regulations and end-users</li>
<li>Make<strong> QGIS an example of security-aware OpenSource project</strong>, helping other OSGeo projects to improve</li>
</ul>
<p>While QGIS and QGIS server are the main components on which this project focus, improving QGIS security as a whole also needs to consider underlying libraries ( e.g. GDAL/OGR, PROJ, GEOS…).</p>
<p>This project is a specific effort to raise the level of security of QGIS. Maintaining security in the long term will need further efforts, and we encourage you to sponsor QGIS.org, becoming a sustaining member of QGIS.</p>
<p>Memory safety, signing binaries, supply chain management, contributing processes, plugin security, cybersecurity audits and much more topics are included in this project. You can see <strong>all items as well as work packages</strong> on the dedicated website :</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><a href="https://security.qgis.oslandia.com">https://security.qgis.oslandia.com</a></strong></p>
<h2>Project organization – Pledge !</h2>
<p>Any organization interested in improving QGIS security can contribute to funding the project. We are looking for an estimated total amount of 670K€, divided into 3 work packages <img alt="➡" class="wp-smiley" src="/img/subscribers/qgis_oslandia/le-security-project-for-qgis-contribuez-maintenant/27a1.webp" style="height: 1em;"/> <a href="https://oslandia.com/en/security-project-for-qgis/#pledge">Pledge now !</a></p>
<p>Once funded, Oslandia and partners will start working on <strong>Work Package 1 in 2025</strong>. We intend to work closely with the QGIS community, QGIS.org, interested partners and users. Part of the work are improvements over the current system, other require changes to processes or developer’s habits. Working closely with the user and developer’s community to raise our security awareness is fully part of the project.</p>

You can see the<strong> full list of topics, work packages and estimated budge</strong>t on the project’s dedicated page : <a href="https://security.qgis.oslandia.com">security.qgis.oslandia.com</a> . You are invited to participate, but also to <strong>help spread the word</strong> and recruit other contributors !</p>
<p>We want to <strong>especially thank Orange France</strong> for being a long-time supporter of OpenSource in general and QGIS particularly, and the first backer of the Security Project for QGIS !</p>
<p>Should you have any question, or need further material to convince other stakeholders, <a href="mailto:infos+qgis@oslandia.com">get in touch</a> !</p>
