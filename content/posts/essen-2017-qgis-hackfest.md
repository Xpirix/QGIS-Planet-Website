Another great QGIS hackfest is gone, and it’s time for a quick report.

The location was the Linux Hotel, one of the best places where open source developers could meet, friendly, geek-oriented and when the weather is good, like this time, villa Vogelsang is a wonderful place to have a beer in the garden while talking about software development or life in general.

This is a short list of what kept me busy during the hackfest:
<ul>
<li>fixed some bugs and feature requests on the official QGIS plugin repo that I’m maintaining since the very beginning</li>
<li>make the QGIS official plugin repository website mobile-friendly</li>
<li>QGIS Server Python Plugin API refactoring, I’ve completed the work on the new API, thanks to the ongoing server refactoring it’s now much cleaner than it was in the first version</li>
<li>attribute table bugs: I started to address some nasty bugs in the attribute table, some of those were fixed during the week right after the hackfest</li>
<li>unified add layer button, we had a productive meeting where we decided the path forward to implement this feature, thanks to Boundless that is funding the development, this feature is what’s I’m currently working on these days</li>
</ul>
Thanks to all QGIS donors and funders that made yet another great hackfest possible and in particular to Boundless Spatial Inc. for funding my personal expenses.
