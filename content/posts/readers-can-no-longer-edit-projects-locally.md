<p>Users with the <em>Reader</em> role can no longer make changes to a project in the mobile app. They will not be able to create new features, update existing ones, or delete data. Previously, readers could make edits locally, but the app prevented them from synchronising changes to the server. This update ensures a more consistent read-only experience.</p>
