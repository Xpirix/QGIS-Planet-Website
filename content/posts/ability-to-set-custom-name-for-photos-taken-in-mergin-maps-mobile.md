<p>Mergin Maps QGIS plugin is now capable of setting a custom QGIS expression that will be used as a name for the photos taken in the Mergin Maps mobile app. It is possible to combine field values, variables (even Mergin Maps variables) and other QGIS expression elements to create your custom photo name format (subfolders supported). You can find this configuration in the QGIS project settings &gt; Mergin Maps. </p><p><img src="/img/subscribers/mergin_maps/ability-to-set-custom-name-for-photos-taken-in-mergin-maps-mobile/thumb-e929e0edd0a384d8c25f39ba59d90a92.webp"/>Available since Mergin Maps QGIS plugin 2023.2 and Mergin Maps mobile 2.2</p><p></p><p>Read more about this in our documentation here: <a href="https://merginmaps.com/docs/gis/photo-names/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">https://merginmaps.com/docs/gis/photo-names/</a></p>
