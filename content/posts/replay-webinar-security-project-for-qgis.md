<p>Do you deal with sensitive geospatial data ? Are you concerned by cybersecurity threats ?</p>
<p>Oslandia and partners ( e.g. OPENGIS.ch) launched the « Security Project for QGIS » : a mutualized funding effort to increase QGIS cybersecurity.</p>
<p>️During this webinar, Vincent Picavet first presented the context of the project : new regulations are coming ( CRA, NIS2 ), cyberattacks increase, software see a growing complexity, and QGIS legacy makes it difficult to increase security … and its benefits !</p>
