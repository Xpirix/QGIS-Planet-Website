<p>We’ve added support for ordering entries by value in value relation widgets. To enable this feature, simply check the option in the QGIS layer’s attribute form configuration. Once selected, the list will automatically be sorted by value. See the screenshot below for details.</p><img src="/img/subscribers/mergin_maps/order-entries-in-value-relation-widget/thumb-8c5ec8a5ba2248428064f88e443436bc.webp"/>
