<p>You can now edit multiple features (map objects) at once. After identifying a feature, tap “Select multiple” to start selecting others from the same layer. You’ll then be able to update their data in one go. The multi-edit form supports all common widgets, except photos and relations.</p><p></p><p>A big thank you goes to <a href="https://www.mobilegis.at/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">mobileGIS.at/</a> for funding the development of this feature.</p>
