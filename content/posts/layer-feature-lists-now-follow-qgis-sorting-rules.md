<p>The app now respects QGIS sorting rules when listing features from a specific layer. Navigate to “Layers -&gt; select a layer”, and the feature list will follow the sorting set in QGIS. Sorting can be set in QGIS by clicking a column to toggle between ascending or descending order, or set a custom sort expression through the popup menu. The sorting order is saved in the QGIS project file and will be automatically applied in the app.</p><img src="/img/subscribers/mergin_maps/layer-feature-lists-now-follow-qgis-sorting-rules/thumb-85f6bf3e01fb56663b82d083c36db9d1.webp"/><div class="mb-2 flex gap-3 empty:hidden -ml-2"></div>
