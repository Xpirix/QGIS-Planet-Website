<p>Weâ€™ve added measurement tools to Mergin Maps, allowing you to measure both distance and area directly within the app. The new "Measure" action is accessible from the "more" menu, where you can easily add points to calculate lengths and areas in your projects. The process is similar to creating a line feature, with a live display of the measured distance and options to undo, add points, or complete the measurement. Measurements are following your QGIS distance and area project units.</p><p></p><p>Read more about the measurement tool in our documentation: <a href="https://merginmaps.com/docs/field/measure/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">https://merginmaps.com/docs/field/measure/</a></p>
