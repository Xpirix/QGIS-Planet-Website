<p>Last week I posted <a href="http://nyalldawson.net/2016/08/how-to-effectively-get-things-changed-in-qgis/">regarding some thoughts</a> I&#8217;ve had recently concerning what I perceive as a general confusion about how QGIS is developed and how users can successfully get things to change in the project. The post certainly started a lot of conversation! However, based on feedback received I realise some parts of the posts were being misinterpreted and some clarification is needed. So here we go&#8230;</p>
<h3>1. Please keep filing bug reports/feature requests</h3>
<p>I don&#8217;t think I was very clear about this &#8211; but my original post wasn&#8217;t meant to be a discouragement from filing bug reports or feature requests. The truth is that there is a LOT of value in these reports, and if you don&#8217;t file a report then the QGIS team will never be aware of the bug or your feature idea. Here&#8217;s some reasons why you SHOULD file a report:</p>
<ul>
<li>QGIS developers are a conscientious mob, and generally take responsibility for any regressions they&#8217;ve caused by changes they&#8217;ve made. In other words, there&#8217;s very much an attitude of &#8220;<em>I-broke-it, I&#8217;ll-fix-it</em>&#8221; in the project. So, if a new feature is buggy or has broken something else then filing bugs ASAP is the best way to make the developer aware of these issues. In my experience they&#8217;ll usually be addressed rapidly.</li>
<li>As mentioned in the original post &#8211; there&#8217;s always a pre-release bug fix sprint, so filing a bug (especially if it&#8217;s a critical one) may mean that it&#8217;s addressed during this sprint.</li>
<li>Filing feature requests can gain traction if your idea is innovative, novel, or interesting enough to grab a developer&#8217;s attention!</li>
</ul>
<p>Speaking for myself, I regularly check new incoming tickets (at least once a day), and I know I&#8217;m not the only one. So filing a report WILL bring your issue to developer&#8217;s attention. Which leads to&#8230;</p>
<h3>2. Frustration is understandable!</h3>
<p>I can honestly understand why people get frustrated and resort to an aggressive &#8220;<em>why hasn&#8217;t this been fixed yet?!</em>&#8221; style reply. I believe that these complaints are caused because people have the misunderstanding that filing a bug report is the ONLY thing they can do to get an issue fixed. If filing a report IS the only avenue you have to get something fixed/implemented, then it&#8217;s totally understandable to be annoyed when your ticket gets no results. This is a failing on behalf of the project though &#8211; we need to be clearly communicating that filing a report is the LEAST you can do. It&#8217;s a good first step, but on its own it&#8217;s just the beginning and needs to be followed up by <a href="http://nyalldawson.net/2016/08/how-to-effectively-get-things-changed-in-qgis/">one of the methods I described in the initial post</a>.</p>
<h3>3. It applies to more than just code</h3>
<p>When I wrote the original piece I focused on just the code aspect of the QGIS project. That&#8217;s only because I&#8217;m a developer and it&#8217;s the area I know best. But it applies equally across the whole project, including documentation, translations, infrastructure, websites, packaging QGIS releases, etc. In fact, some of these non-code areas are the best entry points into the project as they don&#8217;t require a development background, and eg the documentation and translation teams have done a great job making it easy to submit contributions. Find something missing in the QGIS documentation? Add it yourself! Missing a translation of the website which prevents QGIS adoption within your community? Why not sponsor a translator to tackle this task?!</p>
<h3>4. It applies to more than just QGIS!</h3>
<p>Again, I wrote the original piece focusing on QGIS because that&#8217;s the project I&#8217;m most familiar with. You could just as easily substitute GDAL, GEOS, OpenLayers, PostGIS, Geoserver, R, D3, etc&#8230; in and it would be equally valid!</p>
<p>Hopefully that helps clarify some of the points raised by the earlier article. Let&#8217;s keep the discussion flowing &#8211; I&#8217;d love to hear if you have any other suggestions or questions raised by this topic.</p>
