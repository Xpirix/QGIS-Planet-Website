<p>The latest version of the mobile app now supports field aliases with dynamic expressions! You can set this up in QGIS by going to Layer Properties â†’ Attributes Form, selecting a field and clicking the icon next to the alias input. From the context menu, choose Edit to define your expression. This allows field names to change dynamically based on your data.</p>
